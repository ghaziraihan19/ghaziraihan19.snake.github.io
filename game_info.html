    <h2>Snake Game History</h2>
    <p>Snake is a classic game that was first introduced in the late 1970s. The game became very popular during the era of vintage mobile phones, especially on Nokia devices.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>1. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake.</p>
    <p>2. Eat the food scattered on the screen to make your snake grow longer.</p>
    <p>3. Avoid hitting the walls or your snake's own tail. If that happens, the game will end.</p>
    <p>4. Try to achieve the highest score!</p>
